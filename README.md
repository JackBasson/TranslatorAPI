# TranslatorAPI

I was set a task to write JS that makes a GET request to an API which translates the user's input text into Yoda translated text.

Initially I wrote the code in a large block however a peer review and reading on the Single Responsibility Principle highlighted that it was best practise to break this up into smaller chunks
